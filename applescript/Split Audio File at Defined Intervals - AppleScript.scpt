From:
http://askubuntu.com/questions/286624/what-input-types-of-files-can-ffmpeg-convert-and-to-what-output-files/286655#286655

NOTE: This list contains non-audio file types, i.e., as video files.

I do not feel the urge to create a list that only contains audio file types.

But just note that this script has been designed to split exclusively AUDIO files. If you do use a non-audio file as the source file... the splitting functon might still not work...or it might give the user an error later on while getting the data for the summary dialog. So, if it matters to you, you should write some code to catch a non-audio file extension (that is supported by FFmpeg).

I just tested my script with a .mov file, out of curiosity, and the script worked perfectly, with no error whatsoever.

Of course, YMMV and use video files at your own risk.
